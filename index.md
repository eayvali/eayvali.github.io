# Welcome to My Blog

Iâ€™m a roboticist with roots in academia and over a decade of experience in robotics and autonomous systems. I'm passionate about creating intelligent systems that enhance and empower human capabilities.

I have worked across fields such as medical robotics and autonomous vehicles. My expertise includes algorithm development, verification and validation, and leading technical teams to translate transformative technologies from research to production.

I write about autonomy, AI safety, validation in safety-critical systems, and leadership 2.0. My articles offer a mix of technical deep dives, actionable frameworks, and insights that connect theory to practice.
